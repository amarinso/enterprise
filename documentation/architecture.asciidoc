In devonfw we propose the following general best practices:
* Every unit is deployed independently as container
* All communications are E2E encrypted (via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[TLS])
* Users technically connect via HTTPS (web, mobile, desktop)
* Services are implemented stateless.
* Each service has its own database or at least schema. It has the sovereignty on its data. Nobody but the service itself is allowed to write to this data.
* The services have to be tailored according to business demands whilst following a technical decoupling and the _separation of concerns_ (SoC) principle. It is todays architecture management to cut these services and their dependencies properly! This is not easy so put your energy here to get it right and do not mess it.
* Do not reinvent the wheel. Consider to BUY a service before you BUILD it. Use standards and products wherever suitable. Never build your own IAM, Input-/Output-Management, DMS or BPM system! Whey you buy consider your options well to choose the right products and services.
